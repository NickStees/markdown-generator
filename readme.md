# Markdown File Generator

This script is used for creating markdown files for the testing of static site generators such as Jekyll, Hugo or Grav CMS.

Clone the repo and run `npm instal` then run `node generate-md-files.js` which should use faker.js to create lorem ipsum type markdown files and folders.

You can adjust the script as needed for the CMS you are attempting to load test.
